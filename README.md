# Space-Explorer-app
A User Interface (UI) design using Adobe XD for a space exploration app

### Concept
To design a space exploration app with a modern UI.

### Requirements
The app design will be created using Adobe XD and the available toolkits.

The app must be intuitive and easy to use without training.

The design must include the end-user functionality to demonstrate how the app will be played.

The design would assume the game will be played on a tablet device or mobile phone. So, it will require a UI that supports touch user action well.

While the app itself will not be built as part of this project, the design must support an app created with React.

### Design Notes
The design will incorporate a strong visual style and use good quality images for different locations.

A galaxy grid view will show available solar systems with their distance from the players location.

### Designer Notes
This project is mostly for fun, but if I do decide to learn React, this is the kind of project that would hold my interest and provide an enjoyable challenge.

The app is intended to include random elements, and be played in a persistent universe. When a player travels to an unexplored system, the app generates the celestial phenomena from a series of rules. This is then stored along with who discovered it. 

The app also includes random encounters when travelling from location to location. Supports multiple locations within a solar system at either planets, dust, ice or asteroid fields. There would be a defined "core" civilised space with "frontier" outer reaches and finally the unexplored region.

Players have a vessel with capabilities, can perform tasks like mining, piracy, trade and exploration.

I may adopt an aging mechanism, so each action they take has a cost of time and the aim of the game is to achieve as much as they can within their pilots career. If they are captured by pirates (and survive) they will lose time as they would if they are inprisoned by the authorities. At the end of their career the app provides a list of their achievements. This game mode though may be optional in addition to a Open play mode where the player just plays their way.

### Resources
[Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html) - Used for prototyping and sharing the interactive design.

### Design Evolution
The design is intended to evolve and be refined over time. If there are significant deviations in the design, I will create a new branch and provide the updated version while preserving the previous.
